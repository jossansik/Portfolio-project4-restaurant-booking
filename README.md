## About this project

This project is a "Full-Stack Toolkit"-site based on business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset. Authentication mechanisms and role-based access determine admin handling of the site's data or provided activites for the users.

For this project I have designed and built a website for a fictive restaurant with itâ€™s own booking system. The user gets to interact and register for the service of booking a table and can also cancel their reservation. Tables as well as the menus are handled within the database which provides staff with the abitily to organize their activities in a flexible way.

The Restaurant's home page is created as a sort of landing page with a single call to action and the ambition to make people book tables and visit the restaurant. It has been customized for the user experience in regards to content, design, structure and copy, and feature a fully functional Python+Django based booking system with admin site.

## Technology

This project is built with Python+Django, JavaScript (Jest as testing library), HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap 5), using [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) as relational database. The application is run, operated and deployed through Heroku.

Images and media are uploaded and stored through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). 

## Setup
The project is deployed through [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and accessed at https://restaurant-lefleur.herokuapp.com/.

## UX design

A thorough compilation of the UX design work process for this project, from research materials to design, is found in [this](https://www.figma.com/file/vUAdTR0Jn5mYmqFcJwIQYa/RESTAURANT-BOOKING-SYSTEM?node-id=0%3A1) FigJam file.

All wireframes, design specs & images can be found in [this](https://www.figma.com/file/MRf2HQrf1NJxT0Mxkty4Xj/Restaurant-booking-system?node-id=0%3A1) Figma file

Business Vision:

Description: The vision is to create a restaurant booking platform for restaurant guests as well as owners to simplify the process for booking tables. In the impact map and flow chart below, I have described the goals, actions & impacts for two different target groups for this app. The goal applies to both groups, ie increased number of tables booked. 

Target Groups: restaurant guests / restaurant owners & staff.

Needs: simple booking & finding info / easy management.

Business goals: helping people make and manage bookings / increase number of booked tables & visitor rates.

Product: restaurant booking app/plattform.

The impact map below is based on the Business Vision
