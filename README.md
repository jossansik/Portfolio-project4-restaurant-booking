## About this project

This project is a "Full-Stack Toolkit"-site based on business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset. Authentication mechanisms and role-based access determine admin handling of the site's data or provided activites for the users.

For this project I have designed and built a website for a fictive restaurant with it’s own booking system. The user gets to interact and register for the service of booking a table and can also cancel their reservation. Tables as well as the menus are handled within the database which provides staff with the abitily to organize their activities in a flexible way.

The Restaurant's home page is created as a sort of landing page with a single call to action and the ambition to make people book tables and visit the restaurant. It has been customized for the user experience in regards to content, design, structure and copy, and feature a fully functional Python+Django based booking system with admin site.

## Technology

This project is built with Python+Django, JavaScript (Jest as testing library), HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap 5), using [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) as relational database. The application is run, operated and deployed through Heroku.

Images and media are uploaded and stored through [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). 

### Data schema

The chart below fully describes the data scema:

![restaurant_app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181788316-1265c642-afa5-43ea-8e8f-0dc1fd91bd2a.png)

All data models except for Table, Reservation, Menu and MenuItem is default generated by django.

## Setup
The project is deployed through [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and accessed at https://restaurant-lefleur.herokuapp.com/.

### Business Vision:

Description: The vision is to create a restaurant booking platform for restaurant guests as well as owners to simplify the process for booking tables. In the impact map and flow chart below, I have described the goals, actions & impacts for two different target groups for this app. The goal applies to both groups, ie increased number of tables booked. 

Target Groups: restaurant guests / restaurant owners & staff.

Needs: simple booking & finding info / easy management.

Business goals: helping people make and manage bookings / increase number of booked tables & visitor rates.

Product: restaurant booking app/plattform.

The impact map below is based on the Business Vision

## Bugs

Bugs found and fixed during the development process:

[BUG: User can have multiple reservations](https://github.com/jossansik/Portfolio-project4-restaurant-booking/issues/15)

[BUG: Prevent guest from manipulating reservation time](https://github.com/jossansik/Portfolio-project4-restaurant-booking/issues/17)

Because Jigsaw validator warned about font awesome stylesheet these icons have been removed and replaced with static images. These social media icons are not links and therefore do not lead anywhere since this is not a real restaurant.

Unresolved issue:

Due to html not supporting module javascript there is an error in the 'My reservation' page. This is because jest-test-library requires 'module' to be used to fetch the javscript into the test javascript class.

It is possible to use 'default export' as an option for the javascript to run, but then the test won't run and vice versa.

This doesn't effect the user experience, see image below:

![Javscript error in my reservation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181754042-7abb7a79-6202-4412-931f-1b96e5c05441.png)

## Validator testing

### Python validation
All the python files pass validator testing pep8online without issues, except for the settings.py file in restaurant_project which is auto-generated by django. This file gets 'E501 line too long' on AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS. I do not like to change this since it is auto-generated.

![pep8_validation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181763626-c7229c1e-ba16-4e0f-867a-b63333f0998e.png)

### Css validation:

When validating the style.css file separatly this is the result:

![Jigsaw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181765339-a2780c28-0d8d-44b6-acf0-dc3fa1c7cda7.png)

Jigsaw warns about google font import which is as expected:

![Jigsaw warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181765484-60c83e29-99ea-4cad-8f93-4e67374cac1d.png)

When validating the uri this is the result:

![Jigsaw warns about 3 party](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181768056-03a59545-92a4-4577-b169-d3a6444b99bb.png)

Jigsaw warns about 3-party (bootstrap) library which I cannot affect:

![Bootstrap css warning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181768266-79ec2128-06da-4b9a-9baa-d419fbe1e735.png)

### Html validation:

[validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/) gives no warnings or errors:

![wc3 html validator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181773775-d93ec053-0baa-439e-8769-cd20d10ed789.png)

## Accessibility

Lighthouse audit (when run in icognito mode) gives the following result:

## Deployment

Initial step for creating a app in Heroku:

- Created an account on Heroku.com (from the Heroku dashboard clicked the “Create new app” button).
- Named the app "restaurant-lefleur"
- Selected region (Europe), then clicked “Create app”. 

Using Heroku for deployment, here is the overview:

![Overview of heroku app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92020968/181755017-095c572a-75fb-48b5-bf8c-87c7161c2110.png)

The settings in Heroku for my app:

Procfile generates Resources in Heroku (running py tests before deployment):

Heroku built the app using the code in my Github repository:

To deploy I use auto deployment on main-branch, but I can also deploy manually using this button in deployment section:
