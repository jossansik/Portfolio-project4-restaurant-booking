## About this project

This project is a "Full-Stack Toolkit"-site based on business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset. Authentication mechanisms and role-based access determine admin handling of the site's data or provided activites for the users.

For this project I have designed and built a website for a fictive restaurant with itâ€™s own booking system. The user gets to interact and register for the service of booking a table and can also cancel their reservation. Tables as well as the menus are handled within the database which provides staff with the abitily to organize their activities in a flexible way.

The Restaurant's home page is created as a sort of landing page with a single call to action and the ambition to make people book tables and visit the restaurant. It has been customized for the user experience in regards to content, design, structure and copy, and feature a fully functional Python+Django based booking system with admin site.

A thorough compilation of the work process for this project, from research materials and design into production, is found in [this](https://www.figma.com/file/vUAdTR0Jn5mYmqFcJwIQYa/RESTAURANT-BOOKING-SYSTEM?node-id=0%3A1) FigJam file.
